    - Removed the [useless] limit in number of results (it was 500 before)
    - You can now list all files for a given platform, as requested :   ...&req=search&platform=68k   for example.
    - Changed all occurences of "title" by "name" which makes more sense, I believe.
    - Rewrote the wtf-esque multiple-fields-to-array things, which simplified other things.
    - "Author", "Category", and "Platform" fields are now arrays of string(s)

    HTTP Auth is still in the todo list but it quite heavily depends on getting apache to run correctly, which is not a quickfix...
    For now, no changes to the the method of geetting results : http get/post with the api key parameter.
